# About INDI

**INDI** (Improve Privacy and Trust in Non-Personalized Information Discovery) is an open-source search engine designed to enhance privacy, transparency, and trust in online search results. Funded by the **European Union** under the **NGI Search project**, INDI aims to address significant issues in traditional search engines, including bias, privacy invasion, and a lack of transparency in result ranking.

The INDI project is a collaboration between the **University of Cagliari** and **R2M Solution**. Together, these partners are working to provide a solution that offers **non-personalized**, **debiased**, and **explainable** search results, ensuring that users' privacy is fully protected.

## Why use INDI?

- **Privacy-focused**: INDI doesn't track your search behavior or create personalized profiles. Your search queries are anonymized, and no personal data is stored or shared.
- **Bias-free results**: INDI applies advanced **artificial intelligence** and **natural language processing** techniques to detect and mitigate bias in search results, giving users access to more diverse perspectives.
- **Transparency**: INDI provides explanations for why specific results are shown, making the search process more transparent and accountable.
- **Open-source**: The INDI platform is fully open-source, encouraging community contributions and allowing users to run their own instances if desired.

If you care about **privacy**, **unbiased information**, and **digital transparency**, INDI is the search engine for you. Whether you use it as your default search engine or run your own instance, INDI provides an alternative to the commercial, data-driven search platforms that dominate the web.

## How INDI works

INDI combines the power of **meta-search** technology with **bias detection** algorithms to provide search results from multiple sources while protecting your privacy. The system ranks these results based on bias, transparency, and inclusivity, ensuring that users see less biased, more relevant information.

The INDI system relies on:
- **Bias classification** to detect bias in search results.
- **Re-rankings** to prioritize less biased, diverse perspectives.
- **Explanations** to help users understand why content is being shown.

## Empowering the community

INDI also features a **crowdsourcing platform** that allows human reviewers to validate bias snippets from search results, ensuring inclusiveness and transparency. Using **blockchain technology**, INDI rewards reviewers with **crypto-assets** for their contributions, promoting a decentralized, collaborative ecosystem.

By contributing as a reviewer, you can help make the internet a more transparent and unbiased place.
